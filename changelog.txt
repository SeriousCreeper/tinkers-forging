v1.0.8

Changes:
 - Material Registry is now dynamic! This allows other Tinker's Construct materials or other recognized metals to be added! Yay!
 - Added a config option to disable automatic heating from the Tinker's Construct casting table (if you want)
 - Charcoal placement will now only place on top of the block you click on - should fix most issues where charcoal placement took priority over opening an inventory.
